# Tepis
Tepis is a procedurally generated roguelike/dungeon crawler with inspiration from games like Castlevania.
I made it to demonstrate my skills in learning how to use procedural generation with Python.

# Current State
Currently the game generates a simple dungeon that will be different each time you start the game that has various monsters placed throughout.
Currently the monsters do not move or attack but the next versoin will be a more complete game with proper battle mechanics and an ending.
